    "    the most confusing thing here is that we are training the local model, but there is a target model which plays a confusing role. the target model gets updated once in a while to the local model in via a weighted average method. the local model is updated everytime we compute the loss. what we are doing is to training the neural net model so that the difference between local_state_action_value and target_next_state_best_action_value becomes closer and closer to reward for all <state, action, nex_state, reward, status> observations. I feel the key is that we observe the reward. Ideally you want to update the target as soon as you update the local model parameters, but i think this results in numerical/optimization instability. That is why the target model is updated only after "
